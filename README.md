## AI Game of the Day

AI Game of the Day is an experiment in how AI can help create living, repeatable learning experiences—not just static content.

Every morning, the system automatically generates a brand-new math game for kids ages 7–9. Each one costs less than 10 cents to create, is instantly deployed live, and stores creation metatdata(model, prompt, and process) so the evolution of the games can be observed over time.

This isn’t about “one game.” It’s about building a framework for continuous, AI-driven creative iteration—making learning playful, scalable, and accessible.

Features
	•	Daily Games – A fresh AI-generated math game every morning.
	•	Traceability – Metadata includes the model, prompt, and process for every game.
	•	Cost Efficiency – Each game is generated for pennies.
	•	Accessibility – Designed to support learners who benefit from playful, nontraditional approaches.
	•	Archive & Hall of Fame – Browse past games and see standout favorites.

Why

AI Game of the Day explores how AI can shift from generating static artifacts to powering ongoing, evolving experiences—a future where fun learning tools grow and adapt daily, shaped by creativity, automation, and feedback.
