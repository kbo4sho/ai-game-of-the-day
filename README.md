## AI Game of the Day

AI Game of the Day is an experiment on how AI can be used to automate the creation of fun, tailored, learning experiences.

Every morning, the system automatically generates a brand-new math game for kids ages 7–9. Each one costs less than 10 cents to create, is instantly deployed live, and stores creation metatdata(model, prompt, and process) so the evolution of the games can be observed over time.

This isn’t about "one game” its about exploring a framework for continuous, AI-driven creative iteration—making learning playful, scalable, and accessible.

Features
	•	Daily Games – A fresh AI-generated math game every morning.
	•	Traceability – Metadata includes the model, prompt, and process for every game.
	•	Cost Efficiency – Each game is generated for pennies.
	•	Accessibility – Designed to support learners who benefit from nontraditional approaches.
	•	Archive & Hall of Fame – Browse past games and see standout favorites.

Why

AI Game of the Day explores how AI can power content pipelines of evolving learning experiences that grow and adapt daily, shaped by feedback, automation and creativity.
