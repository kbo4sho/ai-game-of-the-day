# AI Game of the Day

AI Game of the Day is an experiment to see how AI can be used to automate the creation of low cost, customized, learning experiences, that are accessible. It isn’t about "one game” right now, its about building a framework that can create consistently fun learning expereinces. And through a history of daily games, document that evolution.

Every morning, the system automatically generates a new learning game for kids. Each one costs less than 10 cents to create, is instantly deployed live, and stores creation metatdata(model, prompt, and process) so the evolution of the games can be observed over time as I update the prompts, workflow, and models.

### Features
	•	Daily Games – A fresh AI-generated learning game every morning.
	•	Traceability – Metadata includes the model, prompt, and process for every game.
	•	Cost Efficiency – Each game is generated for pennies.
	•	Accessibility – Supports learners who benefit from nontraditional approaches.
	•	Archive & Hall of Fame – Browse past games and see next level favorites.
