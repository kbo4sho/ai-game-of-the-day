# AI Game of the Day

AI Game of the Day is an experiment to explore how AI can automate the creation of low cost customized accessible learning experiences. The focuse isn't on "one game” right now, its about building a framework that can automatically create consistently fun learning expereinces.
Every morning, the system automatically generates a new customizable learning game for kids. Each one costs less than 10 cents to create, and consits of generation, enahancement, and accessiblity steps. Each is instantly deployed live, and stores creation metatdata(model, prompt, and process) so the evolution of the games can be observed over time as the prompts, workflow, and models are updated.

### Features
