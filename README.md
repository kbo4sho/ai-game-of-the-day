# AI Game of the Day

AI Game of the Day is an experiment on how AI can be used to automate the creation of fun, custom, learning experiences.

Every morning, the system automatically generates a new math game for kids. Each one costs less than 10 cents to create, is instantly deployed live, and stores creation metatdata(model, prompt, and process) so the evolution of the games can be observed over time.

This isn’t about "one game” its about exploring a framework for continuous, AI-driven playable learning content, scalable, and accessible.

### Features
	•	Daily Games – A fresh AI-generated math game every morning.
	•	Traceability – Metadata includes the model, prompt, and process for every game.
	•	Cost Efficiency – Each game is generated for pennies.
	•	Accessibility – Supports learners who benefit from nontraditional approaches.
